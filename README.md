# Time-class
(Enhancing Class Time) Modify the Time class of Figs. 9.8–9.9toincludeatick member function that increments the time stored in a Time object by one second. Write a program that tests the tick member function in a loop that prints the time in standard format during each iteration of the loop to illustrate that the tick member function works correctly. Be sure to test the following cases: a) Incrementing in to the next minute. b) Incrementing into the next hour. c) Incrementing into the next day (i.e., 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM). 9.8 (Enhancing Class Date) Modify the Date class of Figs. 9.17–9.18toperformerrorchecking on the initializer values for data member’s month, day and year. Also, provide a member function next Day to increment the day by one. Write a program that tests function next Day in a loop that prints the date during each iteration to illustrate that next Day works correctly. Be sure to test the following cases: a) Incrementing into the next month. b) Incrementing into the next year.
